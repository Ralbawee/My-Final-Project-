The following steps are just what I did to create my GUI project it isn't going to be perfect and maybe I am missing a few 
steps but, this is how I did it and it worked for me. 

1. Launch MATLAB 
2. In the Command Window type Guide and Run It 
3. GUI should pop up for you (customize it however you like and make it however big or small you like.) 
4. On the left hand side you should see a varity of options of different UI controls pick whatever you like depending on your 
project (Most of the UI controls I chose are push buttons because I made a calculator) 
5. When You are done customizing your project you can hit the Run button at the very top of the page and this should take you to a code that MATLAB created for you 
6. Go through the Code and see what edits you need to make and what things you need to add in order for your project to run swiftly and correctly. 
7. When you are done with the code you can hit the run button at the top of the code and your project should work. 
8. Have fun with the project you made!
